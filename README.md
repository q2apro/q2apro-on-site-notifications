## For developers ##

It is possible to generate custom notifications from other plugins that will be displayed in the notification list. To do so, an event
needs to be fired with the `q2apro_osn_plugin` event id and with the following parameters:

  * `plugin_id`: ID of the plugin that generated the event. It is not used by the notifications plugin but it is added to the table
  in case an efficient query needs to be run against the table that contains the plugin notifications
  * `user_id`: The user ID that will receive the notification
  * `event_text`: The raw HTML that will be displayed as the notification
  * `icon_class`: A CSS class that must be present in every request that could display the notification

```php
qa_report_event('q2apro_osn_plugin', qa_get_logged_in_userid(), qa_get_logged_in_handle(), null, array(
    'plugin_id' => 'my_plugin_id',
    'user_id' => $receiverUserId,
    'event_text' => '<a href="http://site.com/user/user1">user1</a> mentioned you in <a href="http://site.com/154">this post</a>',
    'icon_class' => 'my_plugin_id_and_css_class',
));
```
